OLIVIER DE WECK: So let's get to work. The V-Model, well, believe it or not,
0:30
but we've arrived today at the bottom of it, the pointy part of the V. We're arriving at the bottom of it,
0:37
and the bottom of it is basically you driving down the design in all its glory and all its details.
0:45
And we call this design definition, and then I want to talk about multidisciplinary optimization,
0:52
including what happens at the CDR, the critical design review. Yeah, go ahead.
0:57
AUDIENCE: All right, I do have a quick question about A4 based to this. Do you want a CAD drawing or a hand drawing?
1:04
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'm fine with a nice dimension hand drawing, but we're gonna talk about CAD next week.
1:13
So I do think it would be good to have a CAD drawing, but you know CAD drawings can come in very different levels
1:20
of detail, right? So I think it would be good to have an idea, if the PDR package--
1:27
most of the PDR packages that you see that have been submitted in prior years at CanSat,
1:32
they do have a CAD drawing in there for their sort of suggested configuration. And you know, it is useful because you
1:38
get to see whether the packaging concept really works. You know, the sketching, you can get away
1:44
with a lot just sketching. So my answer would tend to be yes, but if absolutely, you don't feel
1:51
like you need it or you don't want to do it, then a nice hand drawing with dimensions will do as well.
1:58
OK, so let's talk about the bottom of the V.
2:04
The other thing I'm gonna cover today is this idea of multidisciplinary design optimization, and so where does that fit in?
2:12
So you remember we talked about concept synthesis, concept generation, screening, and selection,
2:18
and then at the PDR stage, you know, we picked one architecture.
2:23
So today's topic is really how do you get this architecture, which is shown as this square
2:29
here to an optimal? And I put optimal in quotes here because we're
2:34
gonna argue what that means, but you've refined the design, such that you can go present it at the CDR.
2:40
So you take this box here, which is your concept, and you open the box-- you can see this on the right--
2:46
and you really dive into the details of the various subsystems and components and how they're connected.
2:53
And what you're trying to do is fine tune your design. So this is shown here schematically.
2:58
Let's say there's a design variable X1 and you want to find where is the optimal point?
3:04
This point here seems to be optimal to minimize metric three and that's the design
3:10
that you're gonna propose. So today's topic really is about fine tuning the design
3:16
and coming up with a CDR level design, that's what we want to talk about.
3:21
And so what I'll cover is different topics. So first of all, the NASA view of this.
3:27
It's called the design definition process. Then I'll talk about MDO, multidisciplinary design
3:33
optimization, the use of so-called CDFs, concurrent design facilities, and then
3:39
finally, what happens at CDR. So the general idea of the design solution definition
3:47
process is that you start with something like this on the left. This is a product breakdown structure, essentially
3:55
your system architecture, your system decomposition. And on the right side, you then translate this
4:02
to a detailed design, OK? So for a launch vehicle, we have,
4:07
you know, the flight segment, this is what-- actually it's gonna fly and it has a payload element, the spacecraft
4:13
bus, and then the launch and the launch accommodation. So that's the general idea is you have high-level breakdown,
4:21
but then you need to design every piece. You need to have chosen your materials.
4:26
You need to have chosen the dimensions. You need to understand the interfaces. And for every part, you also need to decide what?
4:34
What's a big decision that you need to make when you go to the detailed design,
4:41
beside, you know, material, dimensions, software? What is always a big decision to make
4:50
when you do a detailed design?
4:55
Go ahead. AUDIENCE: Maybe the interfaces between the two. OLIVIER DE WECK: Yep, interfaces, all that. What I'm trying to get at is COTS.
5:03
Who knows this acronym, COTS? Let's see if the, EPFL, anybody know COTS?
5:09
What does it mean?
5:17
I think we can't hear you right now. AUDIENCE: Commercial off the shelf. OLIVIER DE WECK: Commercial off the shelf.
5:23
So you have to decide in the detailed design are you going to pick components from a catalog,
5:32
or are you going to custom design these components, right? And so one of the things at the CDR, that
5:39
I always ask the question-- so you present your CDR design. What percentage, what fraction of your parts at the lowest
5:47
level are COTS and what fraction did you custom design?
5:54
Mike, you've done a lot of these unmanned aerial vehicles and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about, you
6:01
know, what's the typical fraction of COTS, and how do you make that decision when you design,
6:07
you know, a flying thing? AUDIENCE: It really depends on the scale and how robust.
6:14
The problem with COTS in the unmanned world is that you can easily go to hobby grade parts.
6:20
And so if you want to get into more of the commercial, kind of more robust, almost more like defense
6:26
kind of, like, robustness and you know, durability, you really have to start going to custom designed parts.
6:33
Because you know, if you can do a whole design space of, you know, all the COTS parts, but you know,
6:39
they're always just kind of, you now, Chinese-made electric motors and batteries, and none of them that will perform to, like, commercial spec,
6:46
but it just depends, really, what you need for the vehicle. OLIVIER DE WECK: I see.
6:51
So what you're saying is there's a gap. You can get a lot of COTS stuff at the hobby shop level, right?
6:58
So they're pretty affordable but low reliability. Or you have really high end, very expensive, you know,
7:05
low production-- AUDIENCE: Like traditional aerospace grade, yeah. OLIVIER DE WECK: But there's not much in the middle.
7:11
Is that what you're saying? AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure. Yeah. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good. So you know, that's the reality of detailed design
7:18
that you're gonna face. And surprisingly, in kind of the formal system engineering methodology, there's not a lot of guidance on this.
7:26
There's not a lot of, you know, guidance to say what's the optimal fraction of commercial off the shelf parts?
7:33
This is really something you have to work out yourself, and depending on, you know, whether you're in aerospace
7:40
or medical devices or automotive or making toothpaste, there's--
7:47
actually, yesterday there was also a big case study on diapers. Diapers is a $3 billion business, believe it or not.
7:54
And they were going for-- their solution A was to go for a COTS solution, you know, a lot of vendors.
8:01
And then they said, no. It's just gonna give us, sort of, average, mediocre performance.
8:07
We want something much better. So they went for a much higher custom design solution. Took them took them a while to do it,
8:14
but it was worth it in the end. So this is a big decision you have to make. So the point here being, at the end,
8:22
you have a very detailed design. You have blueprints. You have something you can actually build. So you know, this is a list of all the things you need to do.
8:32
You define the solution space, develop your alternatives. All the things we've already talked
8:38
about at the conceptual level, but you do this at every-- you do it at the subsystem level, and even
8:43
at the component level. What are the alternate designs? Cost performance and schedule.
8:48
Select your design solution, drive it down to the lowest level of detail, and then identify
8:54
the enabling products, which would be like support equipment and things like this.
8:59
So the best illustration I can give you why this matters is these two pictures I'm gonna show you.
9:07
The top picture that you see here, this is a picture that was drawn in the '70s to sell the space
9:14
shuttle program to US Congress. This was the vision, right? This is the orbiter, and you can see
9:21
it's sitting there in this pristine hangar, right, very clean, shiny floors, maybe four or five people.
9:28
The payload bay is open. There's, like, one or two carts of ground support equipment.
9:35
You just load up your new satellite, close the doors, and off you go for your next mission.
9:40
That's a reusable vehicle. That's what we wanted, and then what we actually got is this.
9:49
You can't even see the orbiter, right? But I promise you, it's in there.
9:54
It's hidden in that scaffolding. So this was the-- it's retired now, but this was the orbiter processing facility at the NASA
10:01
Kennedy Space Center. And the reality was that to turn around
10:07
an orbiter between flights was almost like rebuilding it. And the two subsystems that required the most person hours
10:16
of work were the main engine-- the main engine basically had to be disassembled and inspected
10:23
and so forth-- and what was the other system? What's that?
10:28
AUDIENCE: Heat shield. OLIVIER DE WECK: The heat shield, the TPS, thermal protection system-- if you've ever seen--
10:35
who's seen the shuttle close up? OK, about half, half here.
10:40
At EPFL, who's had a chance to see the space shuttle, the orbiter, close up?
10:45
Anybody? Go ahead.
10:51
AUDIENCE: One or two. OLIVIER DE WECK: One or two. So those of you that have seen it, what did you notice about the heat shield?
10:58
Did you notice anything about the protection, the thermal protection system?
11:03
Who's seen it? AUDIENCE: We do not hear very well here.
11:12
OLIVIER DE WECK: You can't hear me?
11:18
So the point I want to make here is that the thermal protection system, every tile
11:24
is different. Every tile has a different shape, a different curvature,
11:30
and there were good thermodynamic reasons, aerothermodynamic reasons for that,
11:36
but in terms of actually designing, manufacturing, and turning around the vehicle, it was a nightmare, right?
11:43
So that it turned out to be not a very reusable vehicle in the end, and why?
11:48
Because a lot of the detailed design decisions ended up being critical,
11:53
in terms of not really giving us what we wanted, in terms of macro level properties of the vehicle.
12:01
So detailed design really matters. Did you get that point, at EPFL?
12:07
Is it clear?
12:13
AUDIENCE: It is. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, thank you. So here's some-- I'm not going to go through this in detail,
12:19
but here's some flow diagrams, process flow diagrams, from the System Engineering Handbook
12:26
that essentially describe, you know, how this works. So your inputs are your baseline logical decomposition model,
12:34
which is essentially your system architecture, right? And then your baseline derived, your detailed technical
12:41
requirements. You go through all these processes, through all these steps, and then you
12:46
end up with a whole bunch of outputs, which are more detailed requirements.
12:52
The specifications, do you remember, we teased apart requirements and specifications?
12:58
Requirements are what the system should do. Requirement specifications are how the system's actually been
13:04
designed, right, blueprints. So that's specifications at the subsystem level.
13:10
And then you get other things, like a verification, validation plan, and then logistics and operating procedures.
13:16
So very, very detailed work. The other thing that's important is all the design
13:22
considerations that go into making detailed design decisions. So here's a fairly long list of them,
13:28
and you can group them into performance, availability. This is more related to reliability.
13:34
So you could have a system that has high nominal performance but is poor reliability, right, so it's not available
13:41
very much. That's not good. We want high performance and high availability. That gives you your technical effectiveness.
13:49
And then how do you actually operate the system? So operations, maintenance, logistics,
13:54
so that's process efficiency. Together, that gives you system effectiveness. And then, of course, you have the total cost
14:00
of operating the system-- lifecycle cost, total ownership cost. And then system effectiveness and cost
14:06
together, give you what's called here affordable operational effectiveness. So I would argue, in terms of the space shuttle program,
14:14
it had high system performance. It had OK system availability.
14:21
They had-- definitely there were some reliability issues, but it was manageable, but it had very poor process
14:26
efficiency-- operations, maintenance, logistics very, very difficult. So system effectiveness wasn't that high, and as a result,
14:35
the lifecycle cost was also very high. There's a very famous paper, where
14:41
after the shuttle program was ended, a lifecycle cost analysis was done,
14:46
and it turned out that one launch cost about $1.5 billion.
14:52
So during the program, people would say, oh, one launch is maybe $500 million, you know, the variable cost, and the rest is fixed cost.
15:00
But once the program is done, it doesn't matter anymore whether it was fixed or variable cost. All you know is what was the total cost of the program,
15:08
how many launches did we actually do, and you just take the ratio. And it was $1.5 billion per launch of the shuttle.
15:16
And so I would say that's way off from what the original target was. Yeah, Veronica?
15:22
AUDIENCE: Does that number account for crew and crew training?
15:27
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good question. I think so. I think it basically-- whatever was appropriated by Congress
15:33
for the shuttle program, and I think that would include crew operations, as well, yeah.
15:41
So I'm happy to point you to that paper, actually. Yes? AUDIENCE: It also accounted for R&D costs as well, right?
15:46
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, that's correct. It includes everything, all in. R&D costs-- R&D took about 10 years
15:54
and then operations was about 30 years. OK, so you see--
16:01
and of course, within these are budget limits. So part of the reason why the shuttle didn't
16:08
have that high process efficiency was because the R&D budget was capped pretty tightly.
16:14
So rather than optimizing, you know, for maintainability and turnaround, they said, we need to have the system performance.
16:22
We need to have reasonable system availability, and then the rest, basically, is we're gonna deal with it later.
16:29
So what effectively happened is they capped R&D cost, and as a result, the lifecycle cost ballooned.
16:36
I would argue if they had spent, you know, two or three more years optimizing, you know, maintenance and turn around,
16:43
really making it reusable, the lifecycle costs could have been much better, but that's not how it worked.
16:52
So you have a lot of these competing requirements. And so I want to just ask you this--
16:57
this is the first concept question today, OK? So imagine you're-- this is a very detailed design.
17:03
This is just a bracket here, OK? And this bracket was designed so it has, like, a tip load.
17:11
Think of this as a cantilever beam. So it's attached on the right side or left side here.
17:18
You have a load, and then this is your displacement under a given load.
17:24
And these three brackets all have the same mass. They use the same amount of material, OK?
17:31
So you can think of this as you get from the very simple design
17:36
to the more intricate design, you have more design freedom. So you get better performance. You see the displacement goes down,
17:44
but you also have more complexity. So it's more difficult to optimize. It's more difficult to manufacture and so forth.
17:51
And so we can actually show these three choices here on a manufacturing cost, per unit cost,
17:58
versus the displacement, structural displacement under load chart. So our simple design, our one bar design,
18:05
has a displacement of 2.5 millimeters under load, and it costs about $2 to make.
18:13
The two-bar design has much better performance, like 0.75 or something like that, costs about $3 to make.
18:20
And then this 17-bar intricate design has 0.6 millimeters, so the best structural performance,
18:28
but its cost is about $8 per piece. So my question to you is which of these three designs
18:34
would you select and why? So if you could go to that link, enter your answer,
18:44
and then we'll look at the distribution. So we have 39 responses.
18:51
That's good. Ah, interesting. OK.
18:56
So one of you said you're gonna go for the super-duper 17-bar design.
19:03
Most of you, 74%, said the two-bar design. And one of you said one bar.
19:11
And then eight of you, 20%, said you're not sure. I guess you need more information, right?
19:17
So who picked the one-bar design, the simple design?
19:22
OK, so please explain why you picked that.
19:28
AUDIENCE: Well, for my application. I'm planning on mass producing them, and it's for something that doesn't need the degree of displacement that the other ones are doing,
19:38
and so I'm really only seeking to minimize manufacturing cost,
19:43
and the one bar is the easiest to manufacture and also gives me room down the road to iterate if it's not working.
19:50
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so So what would be an example, industry or application? AUDIENCE: Like a children's toy, perhaps,
19:56
where you don't need very strict requirements on displacement,
20:04
something that you're mass producing. OLIVIER DE WECK: Something mass produced, you know, for sort of lower requirements.
20:10
OK, I think that's a valid answer. Most of you said the two-bar design.
20:16
So who said two bars? Let's see at EPFL, who picked the two-bar design?
20:25
AUDIENCE: Sure. It gives you the biggest biggest bang for your buck. For not that much more cost, you get a much more sturdy design
20:35
and that's compared for the 17-bar one. Really, it's still pretty sturdy,
20:41
but you're paying much less, so it seems optimal. OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so if you think about this in a Pareto
20:47
sense, I mean, they're all Pareto-optimal, but this one is at the knee of the curve, right?
20:53
So you're getting, you said bang for your buck or value. If you did, like, a displacement or one over displacement,
21:01
I guess, per manufacturing cost, this one would do pretty well.
21:07
So that's also a very sensible answer. Who picked the 17-bar design, the really intricate one?
21:16
Who picked that? Oh, I think I might have picked that when I tried out the form. [LAUGHS] I think so.
21:25
I can't remember now. It's been already a while ago.
21:30
So if, indeed, I was the one, so how would I justify this? OK, so here this bracket will go--
21:37
this will go on the Mars 2020 Rover.
21:45
And the Rover will see a lot of different thermal gradients.
21:50
You know, it has to be very precise because it holds scientific instruments that
21:55
need to be, you know, pointing very accurately.
22:01
Even though the mass here is identical, but I think we could shrink this. You know, we get the best performance structurally
22:06
for the mass constraint that we were allocated. And cost, you know, this is all taxpayer dollars,
22:12
so this is a government program. So we can spend the money. Of course, I don't mean that really,
22:19
but it is a high-performance application. Therefore, even though the benefit is only small,
22:26
that small benefit is worth it when you look at the whole mission. So we're we're going to pay for that,
22:31
and we're going to go for this high-performance design. Do you see how that works? So the right answer--
22:38
and I think a lot of you said, you know, you're not sure, and it's because-- who said you're not sure?
22:45
Nathan. AUDIENCE: I said not sure because you don't know all the specifications or what the tolerances are or any other information that
22:53
would lead you to make that decision. OLIVIER DE WECK: Right, so you know, what are the requirements, right? We don't know the requirements here.
23:00
Are the requirements shall or should requirements? If it's a shall requirement, what it means
23:05
is there would be some hard limit here, right? The displacement shall be less than one millimeter.
23:12
If that's a hard requirement, then this solution falls out, does not satisfy.
23:17
And if it's a should requirement, then it's a goal that you're gonna trade off. The point I want to make here, this lecture
23:24
is about detailed design. This is detailed design, right? And you're gonna make hundreds or thousands of detailed design
23:32
decisions just like this bracket and together, they're gonna give you, you know, the performance cost
23:37
of your whole system. And so every detailed design decision you make needs to be informed by the requirements but also
23:46
the trade-offs between these properties. Does that make sense?
23:51
OK. So and that leads us-- and so you want to make sure you optimize your system.
23:57
You want to make sure you get-- and I liked, Katya, the way you said it-- get the bang for your buck, right?
24:02
You want to make sure you don't have a lot of inefficiencies
24:07
in your design. So that's what MDO is about. So let me go to MDO here, what it is.
24:14
So there's a technical committee in AIAA, the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics,
24:22
that was founded about 20 years ago. So it's defined as an evolving methodology, a body of methods,
24:28
techniques, algorithms, and related application practices for the design of engineering systems,
24:35
coupled by physical phenomena and involving many interacting subsystems and parts.
24:40
So the main things you need to do MDO are a mathematical model of the system, analysis capability,
24:48
and in some cases, approximation concepts. So what that means is not-- if you put all this together, it could be very, very slow
24:55
and computationally heavy. So you might approximate some of these things, and I'll explain a couple examples.
25:01
Sensitivity analysis, optimization processes, and a human interface-- those are the main ingredients
25:08
of MDO. Who's seen this chart before?
25:14
OK, about three or four of you. Who's seen this chart before at EPFL, this particular graphic?
25:23
Anybody seen this before? AUDIENCE: Apparently, no one. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so let me explain.
25:29
This is a cartoon, OK, and I've experienced this myself working at McDonnell Douglas in the '90s.
25:36
So each of these airplanes shown here is what the airplane would look like
25:42
if that particular discipline or group could call all the shots, OK?
25:49
So let's look at a couple of these. So the controls group is all about controllability.
25:56
So you see the flight control surfaces are very big.
26:02
Now, the problem is the linkages, you know, these control linkages are on the outside. That's really bad for aerodynamics,
26:08
but the controls people say, I don't care about drag.
26:14
I need to make sure my control surfaces are deflecting appropriately. Here's the hydraulics group, right?
26:20
It's all about the hydraulic pump, the filters, and getting hydraulic pressure to all
26:26
the different subsystems. You know, the big engine here, the power plant group, the engine is the most important thing.
26:32
The loft group-- loft means-- lofting is surfaces. You're dealing with the shape of surfaces.
26:39
So let's keep this simple. So we have a little, you know, balsa airplane with little straight surfaces, very easy for loft.
26:48
Production is kind of similar. The aerodynamics group wants a very nice high aspect ratio
26:55
wing, very thin, very low drag. Problem is, there's no room for passengers or cargo here.
27:02
You see this, the stress group? They have a nice wing here in the shape of an I-beam.
27:08
I-beams are great, you know, this is good if you're a civil engineer but not so much--
27:14
none of these things would work on their own. So what we really want is something
27:19
like this, where all these considerations are blended and optimized so we get a high-performance system not
27:28
just a high-performance subsystem. Said another way, a high-performance system
27:34
is not the same as just a sum of individually optimized subsystems.
27:40
That's, in a nutshell, what MDO is about. So one of the readings for today, post readings,
27:47
is this paper, 6A. And this is based on a big workshop we had in Germany
27:53
about five years ago. That's actually longer. It's probably seven years ago by now,
27:58
but the paper came out five years ago called, "MDO, Assessment and Direction for Advancement."
28:05
And this is a pretty international group that put this together. And what we do in the paper, we describe the history
28:11
of multidisciplinary optimization, where it is today, where it's heading, and some of the key milestones.
28:18
So this chart is essentially a kind of history of MDO. I'm just gonna point out a few things.
28:25
The roots of MDO are in structural optimization. So you saw the bracket with all those--
28:32
so there's actually a field called structural optimization or topology optimization, and it's very mature now.
28:39
So you can buy, in some of the CAD packages, there's some specialized tools for optimizing structures.
28:47
And when you look at it, it looks like Swiss cheese with big holes, an Emmentaler, big holes.
28:53
You don't need a lot of structure that doesn't do work for you. So a lot of these structures look like webs,
29:01
and the reason is because the load path has been highly optimized. For example, if you look at the A380--
29:09
I don't have a picture right here-- but you can look at an A380 wing spars and different structures.
29:17
They have more holes than structure
29:22
because they've been highly optimized. So that's the roots of MDO, starting in the 1960s.
29:29
Then, I would say, in the '80s, mid-'80s, we started having more complex decomposition techniques,
29:36
and I will describe one of these to you today. Optimization algorithms were started
29:43
to be built into mainstream programs like Excel, MATLAB, Mathematica.
29:50
And then more recently, you know, in the 2000s,
29:56
we had commercialization of multilevel algorithms, and the one that I'll describe to you is called BLISS.
30:01
So let's talk through a very specific example, and then
30:10
one of those techniques. So here's the example. You're designing a wing, and in designing a wing,
30:17
the two main considerations are structural and aerodynamic. So here's a simplified wing.
30:25
It has a wing area, it has a sweep angle, it has an aspect ratio, and so forth.
30:33
And there's loads acting on the wing as you're flying because of the pressure
30:38
differential between the upper and lower surface. So there's some net force, P, acting on this wing.
30:45
And as a result of that, the wing will warp. So you will have some twist angle in the wing,
30:53
and that's just due to the structural deformation. So that twist angle and the displacements, in turn,
31:01
will change the drag that the wing experiences. So the lift and drag of the wing will change
31:08
as a function of twist angle. But as the lift and drag change, the loads, of course,
31:15
then change as well, and it feeds back into the structure. And in this case, what we're looking for is maximum range.
31:23
We want to maximize the range of the airplane. And this is a sort of simplified version
31:30
of the range equation, the so-called Breguet range equation. And you can see that the structure influences
31:38
the range in two ways-- directly by weight, the actual weight of the structure enters here twice in the range equation, and then indirectly
31:48
through its stiffness, right? The softer it is, the more displacements, the more you affect the drag.
31:54
So it's not so clear then what is an optimal wing? Is it the lightest wing possible?
32:01
But the lightest wing possible will have a larger twist and may have more drag, which will reduce your range, right?
32:09
So should you optimize the wing for lightness or for this minimum displacement or some combination
32:18
or mix of the two? And the answer, of course, is it's a mix of the two. There will be a sweet spot somewhere,
32:25
you know, between a very stiff and very heavy wing and a very, very flexible, lightweight wing.
32:31
There will be some optimal mix of the two, and that's the key here.
32:36
So let me discuss with you briefly-- this is just one of the methods. There are several methods for doing multidisciplinary design
32:45
optimization, but this is one of them called BLISS, Bi-Level Integrated Systems Synthesis.
32:51
And the general idea here in this method is that we have a lower level optimization of each subsystem
32:59
but it's coupled through a system level optimization. And what you want is, you know, an optimal design
33:05
at the system level, not just optimal subsystems. So the context here is we're gonna
33:11
design a high speed, a supersonic business jet. It's kind of shown in this gray picture.
33:19
And we have four major subsystems we're gonna consider-- propulsion, aerodynamics,
33:25
structures, and then the performance, which, in this case, is range, OK?
33:30
And what's important here in decomposing the problem is the x's and the y's.
33:37
Now, the x's are the design variables. Do you remember, we talk about the design variables, the knobs you can turn as a designer?
33:44
And so these here are-- the upper ones, we call them local design variables, you know,
33:49
like the throttle setting, the tail sweep, the wing moment arm, the thickness of the wings, the taper ratio.
34:00
So the idea of a local design variable is that design variable only is used in one of the subsystems.
34:07
It's local to that subsystem. So you basically can choose that in each of the subsystems,
34:16
and it doesn't really affect directly any of the other subsystems-- indirectly, yes,
34:21
but not directly. And then we have the y's here. The y's are the outputs from one subsystem to another.
34:30
So drag, lift, NZ is your maximum load factor, your range, your specific fuel consumption, your wing twist,
34:38
and so forth. So those are outputs from a subsystem or discipline that either matter at the system level
34:45
or are required as inputs by another subsystem. And then finally, the last group here, these
34:52
are known as the shared design variables, so the wing aspect ratio, the altitude, mach number, wing sweep.
35:01
Those are basically required by more than one subsystem, so two, three, or four, in this case.
35:09
Then they are considered as shared variables, and they would be considered system level variables
35:15
because they matter for more than one subsystem. So what this particular method does
35:22
is essentially decompose the problem into the various subsystems, so in this case, again,
35:28
aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and range. And these subsystems are sending this information to each other
35:36
and are all tied together at the highest level through the shared variables, the shared design variables that are shared by at least two subsystems.
35:45
So again, local variables are only unique to a specific subsystem, and then for the wise,
35:51
these outputs, internal outputs, there's a distinction between the Y stars, which
35:58
are coupling variables that are input to a particular subsystem and then the Y hats are coupling variables
36:04
that are output from a particular subsystem. So let's zoom in now on just one of the subsystems,
36:12
let's say, aerodynamics, and see how this works. So here we're zooming in on one subsystem,
36:20
and that's the aerodynamics. And the idea that you can actually optimize just the aerodynamic subsystem by itself.
36:29
So what are the inputs into it? We have aspect ratio, wing twist, and W. So what is W?
36:40
And this is key to this particular method-- the W are the weights, the weights
36:45
that you give to the outputs. So what you're optimizing here is some objective function, f,
36:52
shown here below, which is W1, Y1, plus W2, Y2 plus W3, Y3.
37:01
So you're either maximizing or minimizing that. And what is this here? It's lift, drag, and the lift to drag ratio.
37:09
So what's really cool about this method is that what it essentially is telling the subsystem
37:17
is how to properly weight these different outputs in order to optimize the subsystem, taking into
37:23
account the system level objective. So the weights are not pre-defined,
37:29
but the weights themselves are a design variable. And so you can see the formulation on the right side.
37:35
So given Q, which is your shared variables,
37:41
the Y stars, which are the inputs from the other subsystems, and the weights, minimize your objective function by varying your local design
37:51
variables subject to a bunch of constraints, OK? And so what is one of the consequences
38:00
of being able to formulate the problem this way? So this could be a very high fidelity, aerodynamics model,
38:07
computational fluid dynamics, or it could be what?
38:15
Or it could be a lower fidelity code, right? As long as the inputs and the outputs are the same,
38:22
you can now plug in, you know, different fidelity levels
38:27
of analysis, you know something simple or something based on experimental results, you
38:33
know, panel method, very high fidelity CFD. This becomes very modular.
38:38
The other thing you can do is you can pre-compute a lot of these responses, right?
38:44
So for a given set of inputs, you can pre-compute over a whole range of input variables
38:53
what the response of that subsystem will be, and you can store that information
38:58
and then use what are known approximation methods, like response surface models,
39:03
to save that information, such that when you do the full system optimization,
39:08
you don't have to rerun, you know, the detailed codes every time. You can just pull from the approximation
39:16
you've pre-computed already. So that's one of the really powerful things about this method.
39:23
And that's what's shown here, is you substitute-- you have a series of approximation models, one
39:29
for each of the outputs of the system. You see that? So these little wiggly things here
39:34
are essentially an approximation of that input/output relationship at the subsystem level.
39:41
Could be an empirical function, a neural network, a response surface method, or you know, simplified engineering
39:48
analysis. So you do a lot of this work offline ahead of time for each of the subsystems.
39:55
Does that make sense? Any questions at EPFL? Is that clear how this works, at least in theory?
40:02
AUDIENCE: Everything's fine, thanks.
40:07
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so what we have now is essentially these subsystem approximations, and now we can use them
40:17
for system level optimization. So now let's look at the system level optimization.
40:23
So that's essentially given approximation models for optimized subsystem outputs,
40:30
we want to minimize some objective function. So F, here in this case, which is a function of our shared
40:38
variables, our relevant outputs, Y star, and the weighting
40:45
factors, right, the omega-- not the omegas, the W's, which are the weighting factors given
40:51
to each of the subsystems. And we of course, have to satisfy constraints
40:57
at the system level. So let me show you an example then of what this looks like.
41:04
So here's our supersonic jet. This is our cycle zero, our initial condition.
41:12
Here's the planned form of the jet, and I'm going to show you down here range and just one of the design variables, or a set of design
41:21
variables, which is our wing box sheet thickness. So you go through this, and it converges after 10 cycles
41:29
already. So this is what our business jet looks like after 10 cycles.
41:34
And you know, you see there's a pretty big difference. So the fuselage is much longer.
41:40
This by the way, this is the same in ships, right? Your speed that you can reach, your max speed
41:46
is driven by your fuselage length, your water length. You can see the wings have a pretty high sweep angle.
41:54
This is a supersonic jet. And if we look at the details, we
42:00
see that the range here, the range is about 3,000 nautical miles, and what
42:07
you see is that the exact range that can be achieved and the approximate range merge.
42:14
So the approximation models that you have in this method are only approximate.
42:19
There's some error. And you know, as you run the model several times, several iterations, the difference
42:26
between the approximation and the actual high fidelity result gets less and less, so that it's actually a feasible design.
42:33
And then over here, we see the different thicknesses for the inner wing box, the mid span wing
42:39
box, and the outer wing box. And you can see that early on in the first four or five six iterations, things are kind of moving around,
42:47
but then they're settling out. And so for this maximum objective of range,
42:54
you can see that the inner, mid, and outer wing box thicknesses
42:59
are quite different. So that's the general idea here is that this result--
43:04
this is a fairly detailed design was produced based on a system
43:10
level optimization that included consideration of aerodynamic structures, propulsion, and so forth.
43:18
And there are several other methods, but this is just one of the methods that's been actually quite helpful.
43:27
The challenges now in MDO, in this multidisciplinary optimization are different trade-offs.
43:32
So one trade-off is between fidelity versus how expensive is it computationally.
43:38
So fidelity is over here. So high fidelity means, you know, 3D finite element model analysis, computational fluid
43:45
dynamics. Then you have sort of intermediate fidelity or low fidelity empirical models.
43:51
And then on this axis, we have just doing trade studies, meaning you have sort of a baseline design
43:57
and you just explore from that baseline design. You do limited optimization or iteration or full MDO,
44:03
exploring the full space. And traditionally, you had to choose, am I gonna use high fidelity models?
44:11
But then I can only look at a few points. So then the question is can you do better? Is there a better solution out there?
44:18
Or you can do lower fidelity models and explore the design space very widely,
44:24
and then the question is, can you believe the results because you've done this with approximate models?
44:31
So the real challenge here is we would like to do high fidelity and explore the full design space.
44:37
So that's one of the big research areas in MDO is high fidelity but also very computationally efficient.
44:45
And then the other challenge is quite similar. So it's again the fidelity here, but then
44:52
should you just focus on one subsystem? How many of the subsystems, including, you know, the financial, operations, manufacturing considerations,
45:01
so how many of those subsystems do you include in your optimization? And so you know, ideally, you'd like to do the complete system,
45:10
but then you may have to sacrifice on some of the fidelity. So that's the breadth versus depth trade-off.
45:19
OK so any questions about-- I know this was very fast.
45:24
I do not expect you, by the way, for assignment four or five
45:30
to do MDO on your CanSat. This is really more to give you a feeling for, you know,
45:37
how far things have come and some of the computational frameworks that exist to get you to a really fine tuned optimized design.
45:46
If you are interested in this, you know, we have the spring class. And you know, I hadn't offered this class at EPFL in the past,
45:56
but we actually do offer a distance version with the SDM program. So there may be an option to do this at a distance as well.
46:03
We'll discuss it. But any questions about MDO? What it is, how it works, at least in principle?
46:11
Has anybody done MDO kind of work? Sam, go ahead AUDIENCE: I just had one question about if--
46:18
so here, we're looking at optimizing on one attribute, so range, but if we have multiple attributes,
46:25
it's still up to someone to decide how important those attributes are in the end.
46:31
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's correct. That is exactly right, unless you have a way to combine all these into one objective function.
46:40
And to be blatant about it, to be-- you know, in the commercial world, that's actually clear.
46:47
It's profit or net present value. So if you're designing a commercial product
46:53
in a competitive industry, you can actually pretty easily combine all this into a long--
47:00
you know, as long as you include sort of the key drivers of, you know, your manufacturing costs.
47:07
If the product is not as optimal and not as performant, well, probably, you're not gonna be as successful.
47:14
Your market share might be lower. So in the commercial world, people are doing MDO with profitability as the ultimate objective
47:21
function. Now, for situations where it's not about profit necessarily,
47:30
but it's about a bunch of other considerations, then you can't easily combine it. You can still do utility.
47:35
You can do a utility, you know, combine it in utility. But I agree with you, I think a good practice is then,
47:42
in that case, to do the multi-objective, and then you're gonna have a bunch of solutions that
47:47
are all non-dominated, right? And then it's a human decision making process
47:53
to pick among those. Any other questions or comments? What about at EPFL?
47:59
MDO, anybody have experience with this before, multidisciplinary design optimization?
48:05
AUDIENCE: OK, no one, again.
48:11
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, that's all right. So just to tell you, this is really a big deal in practice.
48:17
So you know, the structural optimization has been around, that's pretty standard practice, and you know,
48:24
optimizing control systems. So we've optimized individual subsystems for a long time now,
48:31
at least two or three decades, but optimizing at the system level is relatively new.
48:36
And I think the best companies, the best organizations that are out there, they're really investing in this technology,
48:43
and they're quite good at it. And that's where you can really distinguish yourself from the competition.
48:49
So let's talk about concurrent design facilities. And so I'm actually going to use some material here from EPFL
48:57
because they have a very nice CDF, and I want to give credit here to Dr. Anton
49:03
Ivanov at the Swiss Space Center for some of this material.
49:09
And actually one of the papers is also related to this. Anton used to be at JPL.
49:15
He worked at JPL for close to a decade before going to EPFL.
49:21
So what is a CDF, a concurrent design facility? It's essentially an environment where
49:27
engineers of different disciplines come together to perform, you know, a system engineering study for a project.
49:33
Key elements that you need is the team, the process, the physical environment, which includes the A/V and the software, and then also some way
49:40
to do knowledge management, meaning capturing the results of prior studies and ongoing studies.
49:48
And I'll show you some examples of CDFs. We also do this in academia.
49:54
There's challenges for doing this in academia, a short learning curve, you know, synchronizing this with the academic schedule, and then
50:01
a lot of turnover, of course, as students graduate and so forth.
50:06
So there's challenges. And in practice, what we essentially have is, in a CDF,
50:12
we have a set of models that are linked to each other.
50:18
And these models can be, for example, here's some Simulink models shown.
50:23
Here, there is some Excel models. You can have CAD.
50:29
And one of the tricks is, you know, to link this together in a way that you can quickly execute different designs
50:35
and look at the results from that. So in industrial settings, probably the most famous CDF
50:43
is the one at JPL, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called Team X. Team X has been around for about 20 years,
50:52
and they just had an anniversary where they celebrated
50:58
their 1000th study that was done at Team X. A typical Team X
51:05
study is about a week. So you do a little bit of preparation,
51:10
but people work together in the facility for about a week, and at the end of the week, you have
51:16
basically a conceptual design pretty well worked out.
51:21
And the results have been impressive. So studies have shown that the cost estimates that Team X came up with were within 10% of final mission
51:30
costs, for those missions that were actually built and flown. So of the 1,000 studies that Team X did, a handful of them
51:38
were actual flight missions. But every proposal that is written
51:46
starts now as a Team X study. So it's really a big deal.
51:52
The European Space Agency ESTEC has a similar facility
51:57
in Noordwijk in the Netherlands. As well, all the ESA projects are going through their CDF.
52:04
So one of these is [INAUDIBLE] which is a space-based observatory.
52:09
EPFL is involved in that project. That went through the CDF as well.
52:15
Most NASA centers and then commercial applications in medical devices, painting, shipbuilding.
52:21
And like I mentioned in my introduction, even consumer packaged good companies are now building their version of a CDF,
52:29
such that they can, you know, very quickly, within a couple weeks, come up with a new proposal for a product and all
52:38
the major aspects, you know, the underlying physics and chemistry, the packaging, the business case, everything
52:45
is considered at the same time. Yes? AUDIENCE: I was wondering why--
52:51
what makes the cost estimate so accurate with this method? OLIVIER DE WECK: So there are three major ways
52:58
of doing-- oh, Veronica should answer that question, since she's launching on cost
53:03
modeling for her research. There are three major cost estimation methods. One is bottom up, you know, you have the product decomposition,
53:10
and you add up all the costs. One is called costing by analogy,
53:16
where you look at a prior mission or a prior product and then you look at the deltas. And then the third one is based on so-called CERs,
53:23
cost estimation relationships. It's a parametric method. You can also blend these.
53:29
And you know, I think one of the reasons why it's accurate is because-- there are two reasons why, I would say.
53:36
So you always have a cost share. One of the subsystems is costing. So you have really people who been doing this for a while.
53:44
They know these models, and so there's some legacy information.
53:50
And the more missions we fly, the more products we make, the more robust, essentially, these cost estimates become.
53:58
And then the second, I think, is because people that typically work in a CDF, they're non-advocates,
54:07
meaning it's kind of neutral ground. So rather than pushing a particular idea or trying to be overly optimistic,
54:14
you know, usually in a CDF, the calculations that are done are pretty non-biased,
54:21
and that's not always the case. So that's one of the advantages of the CDF is you're getting--
54:27
you know, people are trying to say, but really, let's make it look a little better. No, no, we can't do this, because the model says,
54:34
you know, it is gonna cost $280 million to do this satellite. And that's based on, you know, within prior models,
54:41
and if you overlay different models, you know, with some error or confidence. That's the right answer.
54:48
So it's these two reasons. There's experience, there's data, and non-advocacy, really
54:54
taking a kind of neutral, unbiased position. So benefits are, you know, improvements of quality,
55:01
quick turnaround for ideas, better cost estimates, and then increased creativity and productivity in a company.
55:09
So let me give you a couple examples here. This is a CubeSat. So this is the ability to design quickly new CubeSats.
55:18
This picture here I'm showing you is the Swiss Cube that was launched in 2009, still operating.
55:24
I think it's the longest operating, continuously operating CubeSat so far. There's like over six years of operational data now.
55:32
And so you know, for the next generation, which is shown here, how would you do a Cubesat in such a facility?
55:39
And there's three steps. You define your decomposition level. So you have your system level, your subsystem level,
55:45
and then at the lowest level it's called equipment. These are the actual components.
55:50
And you have your product decomposition here, and then for each of these components, you have different sheets that give you either component
55:58
choices or give you different parameters like mass power
56:04
with margins that allow you to then choose from this like a menu and pull together your overall design.
56:11
So that's a Cubesat example. But I want to talk to you a little bit in more detail through a design of a suborbital space plane
56:19
that was done in that CDF, and this was a project known as K1000.
56:26
So some of you may have heard of the Hermes, the Hermes space plane. This was a project that the European Space Agency had
56:35
starting even in the '80s, and it wasn't built, but there was a lot of studies done.
56:41
And this is essentially a Hermes-like vehicle but for space tourism, that's the basic application.
56:48
And so you know, how would you design a space tourism vehicle in a CDF?
56:53
Well, you have to start with requirements, right? Without requirements, you're just-- it's like, you know,
56:59
setting-- my analogy for designing without requirements is like taking your ship and going out to sea without a map,
57:06
without a chart, with no destination port in mind. You're just drifting in the ocean.
57:12
You've got to have requirements. So here are the high level requirements for this particular vehicle.
57:18
Level one requirements-- you have to reach an altitude of at least 100 kilometers over sea level.
57:25
Why is that? Where does the 100 kilometers come from? Why is it not 80 or 90 or 150?
57:34
AUDIENCE: That's where space is defined. OLIVIER DE WECK: Right, and what happens to people who go above 100 kilometers?
57:41
AUDIENCE: They get their astronaut wings. OLIVIER DE WECK: They get their-- you have gone to space, and like,
57:47
you know, you can claim that you've gone to space if you go above 100.
57:52
If you don't, if you are at 80 or 90 you don't. That's kind of internationally accepted. So that's really where that requirement comes from.
58:01
The second one is a zero g phase. You should experience weightlessness
58:06
for at least several minutes. Who's done a parabolic flight before here?
58:12
The zero g, you know, the Vomit Comet? Anybody? Wow, we have to get you guys out there.
58:19
At EPFL, are you still with us?
58:24
AUDIENCE: We are. OLIVIER DE WECK: Has anybody done parabolic flights? I know there's a flight campaign coming up in Switzerland
58:32
later this year? AUDIENCE: Yeah, it will be next year, I guess, but unfortunately, no one has done this right now here.
58:39
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right, guys, we have to fix this. This is unacceptable. I mean, we have to work on this.
58:46
So it's very cool to do these parabolic flights, but you only get about 20 seconds, right?
58:52
20 seconds at the top. It's like riding a big roller coaster, basically.
58:57
And then you go down, and then you suffer, you know, 1.7 g's or whatever.
59:02
Then you come back up. But we want several minutes.
59:08
And then the next requirement is that the passengers should carry-- there should be six passengers carried
59:15
on this vehicle. Those are the top level one requirements. Lower level-- level two requirements-- safety.
59:23
Don't exceed six g, positive six g's. The vehicle must be controllable at all times.
59:31
So when you're out of the atmosphere, you have to be able to control the vehicle, that has certain implications.
59:37
The customer experience-- you should be able to see the Earth's curvature and atmosphere,
59:42
that thin layer, at all times. The spacecraft impact on the environment
59:48
should be as small as possible. And then the mass budget, the spacecraft mass should not exceed 11.6 tons with propellants.
59:57
Where do you think that comes from? What kind of a requirement is that? What flavor of requirement is that?
1:00:02
Yeah? AUDIENCE: Transporting it for proper [INAUDIBLE].. OLIVIER DE WECK: Right, so in this case, it's actually a piggyback, right?
1:00:09
You either have a vertical launch or you have a first stage, an airplane from which you
1:00:15
are dropped right? So that's sort of an interface requirement. OK, so once you know your requirements,
1:00:21
you can really start developing your models. So here's a model of essentially the kinematics of the vehicle.
1:00:31
So you have your environment, your atmospheric model, atmospheric density, pressure, mach number, speed of sound,
1:00:38
a gravity model. Then computing the forces and torques acting on the vehicle
1:00:45
itself, looking at the derivatives, integrating that. This is essentially the equations
1:00:51
of motion of a vehicle in its environment that it's operating in, and then updating
1:00:57
that with a certain time step, delta T. So you can zoom in on one of these,
1:01:03
for example, this force model, computation of the forces.
1:01:08
And there's two frames. There's the Earth reference frame and, then there's the body centric frame of the vehicle itself.
1:01:14
So you have, in this case, the aerodynamic coefficients. You have the forces, lift, drag, pitching moment,
1:01:22
and then you have the actuation. This is assumed, you know, the pilots are here in control.
1:01:28
The rocket engine itself, secondary propulsion, the rudders, and then attitude thrusters.
1:01:34
You need those especially-- you know, once you're out of the atmosphere, the rudders--
1:01:40
the aerodynamic surfaces are no longer effective. And we knew this in the '60s.
1:01:45
Vehicles-- like the X15 is very famous. Well, it had thrusters that you could you could actuate once you're out of the atmosphere.
1:01:54
So you know, you can go pretty detailed in this. You would then design the vehicle in a particular way,
1:02:02
you know, particular engine, wing dimensions, aspect ratio,
1:02:08
a particular flight profile, and then that would be a typical result that you would get in a CDF.
1:02:15
There's two curves shown here. The blue curve is essentially altitude and kilometers.
1:02:21
So you see there's the 100 kilometers. We need to get above this, right? This was our requirement.
1:02:26
So we go above 100. That's good. We satisfy that requirement. So looks like a parabola, and then we
1:02:32
have a-- we glide here, essentially, to the ground. The whole mission takes about 900 seconds, 15 minutes.
1:02:40
And then the yellow curve here is your load factor, your NZ, your vertical load factor.
1:02:47
And you can see that's a little noisier as a curve. So we have higher acceleration as we accelerate to altitude.
1:02:55
And you can see that roughly here, roughly in the middle of the parabola, the load factor starts to--
1:03:04
you're basically in free fall. You're basically ballistic, and the peak acceleration
1:03:10
is about 4.3 g's here, so we satisfy that requirement.
1:03:16
And the whole reason we're doing it is for this period here, that zero g experience.
1:03:22
So when the load factor goes to zero, or near zero, that's when you get weightlessness.
1:03:28
And it turns out for this particular flight profile, we would experience 184 seconds, about three minutes
1:03:36
of weightlessness. This is pretty similar to the flight profile
1:03:43
that Virgin Galactic is pursuing, by the way. So you know, looking at this result, you would say,
1:03:54
well, I don't know about the mass here, but from, you know, reaching 100 kilometers keeping
1:04:00
accelerations below six g, this looks like a feasible profile.
1:04:07
Of course, the other thing that we care about is the view, since this is for space tourism.
1:04:13
We want to make sure that, you know, that the experience is great, not just
1:04:20
from an experiencing weightlessness, which you can do in a closed can but you actually see something.
1:04:26
So this was essentially coupled with a virtual reality visualization.
1:04:32
So you can see, you know, the landing here.
1:04:38
You can see these three views here. And you can see the vehicle itself. So the pilots are up front, and then here
1:04:44
is our six passengers. Every one of the passengers gets their own window.
1:04:51
So this is the view that you would get from the front window. This is the view from the middle window.
1:04:58
And then this is the view from the back window, from that last window here, which is closer to the back,
1:05:04
to the engines. So what would you, looking at these pictures-- you know,
1:05:09
this comes directly out of the simulation and the CDF-- what would you say looking at this?
1:05:15
Anything you notice? EPFL anything you guys notice?
1:05:21
Look at the view from the front, the middle, and the back window.
1:05:28
AUDIENCE: From the front, looks better. I guess it will be more expensive, again, for the customer.
1:05:34
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so that's exactly what I was asking. So it looks like either you need to redesign the vehicle so
1:05:42
that the view is the same, more or less, from every window, or you need to start charging differential prices.
1:05:49
Because clearly, from the back window, half your view is obstructed by the wing structure, right?
1:05:59
Would you agree with that? Would you charge different ticket prices for this ride,
1:06:06
depending on which seat you get?
1:06:11
AUDIENCE: I guess that's offer and demand? OLIVIER DE WECK: Supply and demand, yes. That's right.
1:06:17
Go ahead. AUDIENCE: It could also merit a change in flight plan. If your structure blocks the downward view,
1:06:24
you might want to consider flipping over if like the Earth is what you're trying to see from above.
1:06:31
So it may have broader implications for the mission. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so the point here,
1:06:37
is there a way to operationally improve the experience, keeping the vehicle design the same?
1:06:43
Absolutely, but what that means is, you would have to put the operation-- so the orientation of the vehicle,
1:06:50
you'd have to put that into your design vector if you want to change it.
1:06:55
OK, so I don't know. I think this is pretty cool. So you can actually do a lot in this kind of CDF type setting.
1:07:03
And by the way, of the things that spun out of this project
1:07:08
is this company called S3. Their headquarters in Payerne in Switzerland.
1:07:15
This is actually-- I did a lot of my military service at that airport. Their goal is not space tourism, you
1:07:20
see there's no windows on this vehicle, but deployment of small satellites, custom
1:07:25
deployment for small satellites with a reusable vehicle. So you know, I think it's a very interesting concept,
1:07:34
but the question is, is it feasible, right? Is it feasible-- the aerodynamics, the economics,
1:07:42
structurally, engine reuse? There's a lot of-- this is a great picture, but you know,
1:07:48
the devil is in the details. So really working out the details of such a design,
1:07:53
that's what a CDF is for, and you can really go deep.
1:07:58
OK so any questions about this? I'd like to do a little partner exercise here.
1:08:05
Any questions? So let's do a partner exercise, and the question is,
1:08:12
what are your experiences with concurrent design facilities so far? Whether you've done an internship at ESA or JPL,
1:08:21
or some other place that has a facility like this, or even if you haven't been there,
1:08:28
kind of speculate and discuss what it would be like. Maybe, you know, what would be your favorite chair?
1:08:35
Would you pick propulsion or costing or flight trajectory?
1:08:42
You know, just sort of speculate and discuss with your partner, so for which project or application did you use it?
1:08:49
What went well? What did not? What could be improved? And again, if you don't have much experiences,
1:08:54
just think ahead what it would be like. What would you like to get out of it if you have no experience in it?
1:09:02
AUDIENCE: So there is at ESA, a concurrent design facility, and I was talking with Katya that maybe also United Nations
1:09:12
can be considered, like, the facilities there can be considered a concurrent design facility.
1:09:20
I don't know if it worked, this approach. OLIVIER DE WECK: Do you mean in Geneva, United Nations in Geneva or London or New York,
1:09:28
or do you mean in general? AUDIENCE: Exactly. OLIVIER DE WECK: But do they actually have a physical facility with models and screens,
1:09:35
or are you saying this more metaphorically? AUDIENCE: Metaphorically more. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, but you know I--
1:09:43
go ahead. Go ahead. AUDIENCE: Yeah, we're referring to the layout, to the site,
1:09:48
we're looking at the ESA layout, where you have one big room, where you have all the people coming together, all the different models coming together.
1:09:54
So that's like all the different experts. Then you have subrooms for different project rooms, and then you have, like, a big conference room.
1:10:00
That's kind of the structure of the layout of the facilities. OLIVIER DE WECK: But you know, maybe a place like the UN
1:10:08
could really benefit when they deal with a refugee crisis or with, you know, climate change negotiations.
1:10:15
I like this idea. Great suggestion. What about here at MIT? Any experiences, thoughts?
1:10:21
Yeah, please go ahead. AUDIENCE: Yeah, AFRL, we have a rapid innovation officer.
1:10:26
He's like a general equivalent as a civilian, a LOC BOS, and he basically is tasked with breaking all the rules in AFRL.
1:10:36
Whereas most projects take years to complete, he fields questions from the field, from the theater,
1:10:42
from war fighters, and they have an urgent need. And he gets them a solution in under 12 months.
1:10:49
So he pulls in all these experts from industry, academia,
1:10:54
wherever. He'll lock them in a room, and they don't leave until they come up with a solution.
1:11:00
And he has the money and the influence, the backing by the AFRL Commander to get it done.
1:11:05
OLIVIER DE WECK: And what does that-- I mean, if you can share, roughly what does that facility look like roughly?
1:11:11
Does it have, like, models and computers and screens? AUDIENCE: Just white walls, like, whiteboard walls,
1:11:19
and they will just be covered with everybody's ideas by the time they leave there. OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, I see.
1:11:24
So it's not as much computationally supported. It's more of a human process. AUDIENCE: That's right. OLIVIER DE WECK: Cool.
1:11:29
OK. Great. Interesting. Any other experiences?
1:11:35
Anybody been at JPL or seen a commercial facility in a commercial company that does this kind of work?
1:11:42
Please, go ahead, Justice. AUDIENCE: Well it's less of a commercial--
1:11:48
I was interning at the Aerospace Corporation this past summer, and I was working in their concurrent design center. And it uses a similar layout as JPL's Team X's design, where
1:11:58
it's basically using models. That they have, like, a group of engineers who sit at desks,
1:12:04
and there's multiple engineers per subsystem, and they just discuss. They're given a mission objective,
1:12:09
and they discuss how they can best design the system based on that. And they model it and optimize it in the subsystem,
1:12:15
and then they feed it back to a systems level design. OLIVIER DE WECK: Did you participate in that? AUDIENCE: Yes.
1:12:21
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what did you think of it? AUDIENCE: A lot-- it's a lot to take in at first just trying to understand
1:12:28
how each of the models work. You're not necessarily supposed to work on each model,
1:12:33
but as an intern, they wanted me to kind of see what each of the models would do and not necessarily exactly
1:12:39
how the optimization techniques work because I didn't necessarily understand it, but just more of have an idea of how it actually works as a whole.
1:12:47
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good. Anybody else at EPFL want to share any experiences?
1:12:54
AUDIENCE: Apparently not, but just a problem with the sound.
1:13:01
We didn't hear anything on what the guy before just told us. OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, Justice, did you push the mic button?
1:13:09
OK, yeah, so basically, he worked-- let me try to summarize. He worked at the Aerospace Corporation.
1:13:14
He interned at the Airspace Corporation. Was it in Virginia or California? California, in California.
1:13:21
And Aerospace Corporation is like a think tank, and it was a very similar set up with different subsystem
1:13:28
experts, different models. And Justice was saying one of the big challenges is so much information, taking it all in
1:13:36
and understanding all the models and coupling, and so forth. So and I agree.
1:13:41
It takes a while. If you haven't been working in this environment, it takes a while to really get used to it.
1:13:47
So the last thing I'll say here is that-- well, two things.
1:13:53
One is-- and they're linked-- one is that these CDFs are not cheap.
1:13:59
If you really want a high-functioning CDF, you have to have people that are dedicated to this.
1:14:05
You know, the software licenses expire. The technology gets old.
1:14:10
You need to not just use it, but you need to constantly refresh a CDF, keep it up to date,
1:14:16
and it just doesn't happen automatically. You've got to have budget for that.
1:14:21
You have to have people who are dedicated to updating the models, updating the facility, and so forth.
1:14:28
So it's definitely something that needs to be invested in on a regular basis.
1:14:34
So what happened to us here at MIT in air astro, actually, when I was sitting where
1:14:41
you are sitting as a grad student, we created a CDF in the mid '90s.
1:14:47
And you know, it was just like the one at JPL. We had desktops, you know, with labels-- thermal, propulsion.
1:14:55
And we used it quite actively for maybe five, six, seven years, but we didn't put the budget into it every year.
1:15:04
We didn't have a dedicated person who was really. looking after it. So what happened to our CDF is that entropy took over,
1:15:13
and it sort of got more and more dated. And when you go and look in this room now, it kind of looks like a regular conference room.
1:15:20
So all the desktops that we had are gone. I guess they'd be pretty old by now. And there has been a pretty strong debate among the faculty
1:15:31
whether actually we need this. Should we recreate one? And the argument goes as follows,
1:15:36
the proponents say that a CDF is really something special.
1:15:43
When you enter in the CDF, you know this is a special place. This is a facility that's designed specifically
1:15:49
for doing rapid studies. All the information you need is there.
1:15:55
The walls are plastered with reference information. You know, really, that's what it's for.
1:16:02
The counter argument is that this is no longer the mid-'90s.
1:16:08
Now, everybody has laptops. Everybody does mobile computing.
1:16:13
All the models and data should be on the cloud, not sitting anymore in a dedicated server facility,
1:16:20
but it's sitting on the cloud. And therefore, you know, physically, a facility that's dedicated is no longer needed.
1:16:27
What you do is you get together in a more kind of flexible ad hoc way.
1:16:33
Everybody brings their laptops. You have the big white walls, like you said. And you can just create a CDF on the fly, right?
1:16:41
Everybody brings their computing resources. Stuff is on the cloud.
1:16:47
And then you get a lot done, and then you disband again. You clean the white boards and you're done.
1:16:53
Therefore, no longer needed a dedicated CDF. Those are the two countervailing opinions right now.
1:17:04
My view is, I think a CDF still has value today.
1:17:09
I think it is valuable as a dedicated facility,
1:17:14
but it needs to be updated. So yes, the models should be on the cloud. Yes, you can bring your laptops, but it is still
1:17:20
valuable to have dedicated computing resources, again. So I now think a hybrid model is actually the right way to go.
1:17:30
So we'll see where it goes, but it's a pretty active debate. There have also been, you know, theses
1:17:35
written on CDFs, comparing different CDFs and so forth. So take a look at the Anton Ivanov paper in the reading
1:17:45
and just think about this. I think this is a big deal, and it's
1:17:51
going to be even more important than the future, whether you're doing space missions, aeronautics,
1:17:57
whether you're designing commercial products, you know, or in the military, these facilities
1:18:03
that allow you to make these design decisions in a very interactive, very quick way are gonna
1:18:09
be more and more important in the future, and this is a big part of system engineering.
1:18:15
Any final thoughts on this before we move on? OK, so here some lessons learned from the EPFL CDF.
1:18:26
So this is particularly in the university environment, so you know, giving access to a wide body of students.
1:18:33
You need to adapt this to the university's schedule, the learning curves, the analogy of a smoke-filled room or war
1:18:43
room, optimal team size. You know a CDF with 50 people on it is not as effective as one
1:18:49
with, you know, seven plus or minus two. And then distributed CDFs-- they don't typically work as well.
1:18:56
So I almost wore my-- I have a shirt that's almost the same.
1:19:03
Anybody know who this is or where this is from? This is Sheldon Cooper in the Big Bang Theory,
1:19:10
his virtual reality presence. So the point here is that virtual reality is OK.
1:19:18
So you can imagine a CDF where half the people are in the room
1:19:23
and half the people are dialing in remotely, but it's never quite as good as everybody is there physically.
1:19:30
So human interaction is critical. OK, the last thing I want to talk about today is the CDR.
1:19:39
This is a big, big milestone. This is a very big deal. The critical design review, the main purpose of it
1:19:46
is to approve the final design in all its glory, in all its details.
1:19:52
So generally, the way we talk about it is, if you pass the CDR, you've got the green light to quote,
1:20:00
end quote, cut metal. Of course, you know, our systems have software and hardware.
1:20:06
So the cut metal is essentially a euphemism for you can go ahead and manufacture the system now.
1:20:14
CDRs are typically the biggest review. The largest number of people you will have at the CDR.
1:20:22
You know, if you had 10 people at the SRR and 20 people at the PDR, you're gonna
1:20:28
have 50 or 100 people at the CDR. Because any question that comes up on any of the parts--
1:20:35
say, is this really right? Well, what could be the impact of this detail
1:20:40
on the rest of the systems? Somebody should be there who designed that part or who can answer the question at least.
1:20:48
And CDRs are typically longer than one day. In fact, for a big project, a CDR
1:20:53
can be a whole week of reviews. So people get really tired.
1:20:58
Big CDRs are very, very detailed. You really have to drink lots of coffee and stay awake.
1:21:05
So here's the description of what a CDR is. One of the guidelines is that approximately 90%
1:21:13
of the engineering drawings are approved and released. So it's OK to have a CDR if you have not 100% of everything
1:21:21
done, but you need to have at least 90% complete. You can't do a CDR, with, you know, half the drawings done.
1:21:29
And it happens at the end of phase C, the final design phase C.
1:21:35
For very large projects, you can have sub CDRs.
1:21:41
You'll have a system level CDR, and then you can have sub CDRs for every major subsystem
1:21:47
in your project. So an example, I put a link here. This is from late 2014, the CDR for the James Webb Space
1:21:58
Telescope that I mentioned earlier. They passed the last major element level critical design review, which was a big deal.
1:22:08
So launch is planned for 2018. But for big projects, what I'm trying to say is,
1:22:14
there may be more than one CDR. There may be the master CDR for the whole thing
1:22:19
and then sub CDRs for different subsystems. Now, if you don't-- well, let me get to this on the next chart.
1:22:25
Yeah, go ahead. AUDIENCE: Are the, like, CDR slides for NASA projects,
1:22:30
are those available anywhere as a public entity and can you get access to any of that stuff?
1:22:38
OLIVIER DE WECK: It depends. Not always, because especially if commercial companies,
1:22:46
like, you know, Lockheed-Martin or somebody is doing, like, the spacecraft bus, they would consider those details
1:22:53
proprietary. So in general, I would say no.
1:22:58
But for CanSat, actually, you've probably already found them.
1:23:04
For CanSat, you can actually find a lot of this. So prior PDRs and CDRs, you can see that.
1:23:10
I encourage you not to look too much. You know, you kind of want to come up with your own thing. But you know, for projects that don't
1:23:18
have a commercial interest or proprietary technology, it's often available.
1:23:23
So to show you just-- this is a table from the Handbook, page 178.
1:23:30
This is the entrance criteria and the exit criteria for CDR. So entrance criteria means what do you have to have in order
1:23:39
to be allowed to go forward with a CDR? And it's mainly three things--
1:23:45
successful completion of the PDR, and responses made to all the PDR RFAs and RIDs.
1:23:52
RFAs and RIDs are essentially deficiencies, open items that came up in the PDR.
1:23:58
So you have to close them out. A CDR agenda, and then number three is all the technical work packages.
1:24:05
And so you see, it's a huge list here-- baseline documents, specification, fabrication,
1:24:11
assembly and integration, technical data package, acceptance criteria, verification and validation
1:24:18
plan, launch site selection, and operations plan-- super, super, super detailed.
1:24:24
This is a lot of information. And at the CDR, you're gonna go through all this.
1:24:30
So you can imagine what that means. And then success criteria, on the right,
1:24:36
is, you know, in order to successfully pass the CDR,
1:24:42
these are all the things that you have to basically have. You have to have approval for all these things.
1:24:49
Now in reality, just like a PDR, at a CDR, things will come up that you missed
1:24:56
or that people have concerns about. And so you will make a list of those,
1:25:02
and then you have to address these action items coming out of a CDR. If those action items are serious--
1:25:08
if they're really serious, you could fail the CDR and say, you know, this is not gonna work.
1:25:15
We should not proceed. And they send you back.
1:25:20
Or they cancel the project. That's happened also. More likely, is that they'll ask you to do a so-called delta
1:25:28
CDR. So they'll have you, you know, it's like retaking an exam or something. They'll have you come back, and you'll
1:25:35
have to do a CDR again but only on the delta, the portion
1:25:41
that raised concerns at the main CDR. You don't have to do everything again. That's called a delta CDR.
1:25:47
OK, any questions about CDR? This is really the-- this is the big one.
1:25:53
This is the big milestone. And obviously, you know, the concept or the architecture
1:25:58
you chose at the PDR turns out not to be a good one, it's very difficult to make changes to that here, right?
1:26:06
You're kind of locked in to whatever design or architecture you chose at PDR. That's why PDR is also so important, even
1:26:14
though you have less detail. Yeah, Sam, go ahead. AUDIENCE: Do you have to have contracts in place
1:26:19
already for the, like, manufacturing and operations? OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, absolutely. I mean, basically green light CDR, the next day,
1:26:27
you start manufacturing. So you know, every portion, all the components, all the manufacturing, all of that
1:26:34
has been bid, selected, contracted. Everything's in place contractually, absolutely.
1:26:43
OK, any questions at EPFL about CDR? Who has actually gone through a CDR on your end?
1:26:49
Has anybody done a CDR for any of the projects? OK, go ahead.
1:26:55
What was it like? AUDIENCE: I did also a CDR because I had the PDR last time
1:27:01
at the [INAUDIBLE] program. And one comment I want to make. So the teams were allowed to fail the PDR and still fly.
1:27:11
If they failed the CDR, then they didn't fly at all. So it was very strict and demanding
1:27:19
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so would you say that the CDR is more strict than the PDR?
1:27:25
AUDIENCE: The CDR is more strict. OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, I agree. I agree. Definitely.
1:27:30
OK, anybody else? Are any of you working in systems other than aerospace,
1:27:40
like, I don't know, medical devices or you know, scientific instruments?
1:27:50
So the reason I bring this up is because you know, medical devices have to be approved by, here in the US,
1:28:00
it's the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and then in Europe, there is equivalent, you know,
1:28:05
European level thing. It's very, very detailed. It's really not that different. So presenting your medical device design
1:28:13
to a panel of experts-- doctors, you know, people in medical safety, regulators--
1:28:23
it is like a CDR. You basically are going through a CDR when you're trying to get your medical device approved
1:28:29
for sale and use. So it's not often called a CDR, but it effectively is a CDR.
1:28:35
So this is, especially in industries where there's a lot of money at stake and people,
1:28:43
you know, safety, people's health is at stake, this is common practice.
1:28:50
OK, so let me summarize here. So this is the detailed design phase we discussed.
1:28:55
It's very important. Basically, you take your PDR level design and you go define all the details in full maturity.
1:29:04
You create design documents and models. And you know, as we talked about last time,
1:29:10
we're sort of in this transition phase of producing documents versus producing models. Typically, we have both now.
1:29:18
Examples would be detailed bill of materials, computer-aided design files-- we'll talk about CAD next week,
1:29:25
computer-aided design-- software and control system definition, user interfaces, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
1:29:32
Multidisciplinary design optimization is a very powerful concept to optimize
1:29:40
at the system and the subsystem level and trade off between disciplines and objectives.
1:29:45
The CDFs are the concurrent design facilities, and they've now become standard practice both in aerospace
1:29:52
and product design companies. If you have not had the chance to experience and work
1:29:59
in a CDF, I really encourage you to do this. I think it's a life-changing experience.
1:30:05
It really-- it's not easy, because like, you know, Justice said, there's a lot of information to absorb.
1:30:12
But once you've done this and experienced it, you realize if you don't have a CDF,
1:30:19
if you don't design products this way, you really should. And then CDR is the big milestone,
1:30:26
the last gate before, quote, end quote, cutting metal.
