- [Voiceover] Hello and welcome
0:01
to multivariable calculus.
0:04
So I think I should probably start off
0:05
by addressing the elephant in the living room here.
0:08
I am, sadly, not Sal,
0:09
but I'm still gonna teach you some math.
0:11
My name is Grant.
0:13
I'm pretty much a math enthusiast.
0:14
I enjoy making animations of things when applicable,
0:17
and boy, is that applicable
0:18
when it comes to multivariable calculus.
0:21
So, the first thing we gotta get straight
0:22
is what is this word multivariable
0:25
that separates calculus, as we know it,
0:27
from the new topic that you're about to study?
0:30
Well, I could say it's all about multivariable functions,
0:33
that doesn't really answer anything
0:35
because what's a multivariable function?
0:36
And basically, the kinds of functions
0:39
that we're used to dealing with,
0:40
in the old world, in the ordinary calculus world,
0:44
will have a single input, some kind of number
0:47
as their input,
0:48
and then the output is just a single number.
0:50
And you would call this a single variable function.
0:52
Basically because that guy there is the single variable.
0:56
So then a multivariable function
0:58
is something that handles multiple variables.
1:01
So, you know, it's common to write it as x, y,
1:03
it doesn't really matter what letters to use,
1:05
and it could be, you know, x, y, z,
1:07
x one, x two, x three, a whole bunch of things,
1:09
but just to get started,
1:11
we often think just two variables
1:13
and this will output something that depends on
1:15
both of those.
1:16
Commonly it will output just a number,
1:18
so you might imagine a number that depends on
1:20
x and y in some way, like, x squared plus y,
1:23
but it could also output a vector, right?
1:26
So you could also imagine something that's
1:29
got multivariable input, f of x, y,
1:33
and it outputs something that also has
1:35
multiple variables, like,
1:37
I mean I'm just making stuff up here,
1:39
three x and, you know, two y.
1:42
And, this isn't set in stone,
1:44
but the convention is to usually think
1:46
if there's multiple numbers that go into the output,
1:48
think of it as a vector,
1:49
if there's multiple numbers that go into the input,
1:51
just kind of write them,
1:52
write them more sideways like this,
1:53
and think of them as a point in space.
1:56
Because, I mean when you look at something like this,
1:58
and you've got an x and you've got a y,
2:00
you could think about those as two separate numbers.
2:02
You know, here's your number line
2:03
with the point x on it somewhere,
2:05
maybe that's five, maybe that's three,
2:07
it doesn't really matter.
2:08
And then you've got another number line
2:10
and it's y, and you could think of them
2:12
as separate entities.
2:13
But, it would probably be more accurate
2:15
to call it multidimensional calculus,
2:18
because, really, instead of thinking of, you know,
2:20
x and y as separate entities,
2:22
whenever you see two things like that
2:24
you're gonna be thinking about the x y plane.
2:26
And thinking about just a single point.
2:28
And you'd think of this as a function that takes a point
2:30
to a number,
2:31
or a point to a vector.
2:32
And a lot of people, when they start
2:33
teaching multivariable calculus,
2:35
they just jump into the calculus,
2:36
and there's lots of fun things,
2:37
partial derivatives, gradients,
2:39
good stuff that you'll learn.
2:40
But I think first of all,
2:41
I want to spend a couple videos
2:43
just talking about the different ways
2:44
we visualize the different types
2:47
of multivariable functions.
2:49
So, as a sneak peak,
2:50
I'm just gonna go through a couple of them
2:52
really quickly right now,
2:53
just so you kind of whet your appetite
2:55
and see what I'm getting at,
2:56
but the next few videos are going to go through them
2:58
in much, much more detail.
3:00
So, first of all, graphs.
3:03
When you have multivariable functions,
3:04
graphs become three dimensional.
3:07
But these only really apply to functions that have
3:08
some kind of two-dimensional input,
3:10
which you might think about as living
3:11
on this x y plane,
3:12
and a single number as their output
3:14
and the height of the graph
3:15
is gonna correspond with that output.
3:17
Like I said, you'll be able to learn much more
3:19
about that in the dedicated video on it,
3:21
but these functions also can be visualized
3:23
just in two dimensions, flattening things out.
3:26
Where we visualize the entire input space
3:28
in associated color, with each point.
3:31
So this is the kind of thing where you, you know,
3:33
you have some function
3:34
that's got a two-dimensional input,
3:36
that would be f of x, y,
3:37
and what we're looking at is the x y plane,
3:39
all of the input space,
3:41
and this output's just some number,
3:42
you know, maybe it's like x squared,
3:44
this particular one is an x squared,
3:45
but, you know that,
3:46
and maybe some complicated thing,
3:48
and the color tells you roughly the size
3:50
of that output, and the lines here,
3:52
called contour lines,
3:54
tell you which inputs all share a constant output value.
3:58
And again, I'll go into much more detail there.
4:00
These are really nice, much more convenient
4:01
than three-dimensional graphs,
4:03
to just sketch out.
4:04
Moving right along,
4:07
I'm also gonna talk about surfaces
4:09
in three-dimensional space.
4:10
They look like graphs,
4:11
but they actually deal with a much different animal,
4:14
that you could think of it as mapping two dimensions,
4:16
and I like to sort of spoosh it about.
4:18
And we've got kind of a two-dimensional input,
4:20
that somehow moves into three dimensions,
4:22
and you're just looking at what the output
4:24
of that looks like,
4:26
not really caring about how it gets there.
4:28
These are called parametric surfaces.
4:31
Another fun one is a vector field,
4:33
where every input point is associated
4:35
with some kind of vector,
4:36
which is the output of the function there.
4:38
So this would be a function
4:39
with a two-dimensional input
4:40
and a two-dimensional output
4:41
'cause each of these are two-dimensional vectors.
4:43
And the fun part with these guys
4:44
is that you can just kind of,
4:47
imagine a fluid flowing,
4:49
so here's a bunch of droplets, like water,
4:51
and they kind of flow along that.
4:52
And that actually turns out to give insight
4:54
about the underlying function.
4:55
It's one of those beautiful aspects
4:57
of multivariable calc.
4:58
And we'll get lots of exposure to that.
5:00
Again, I'm just sort of zipping through
5:01
to whet your appetite.
5:02
Don't worry if this doesn't make sense immediately.
5:06
And one of my all-time favorite ways to think about
5:07
multivariable functions is to just take the input space,
5:11
in this case, this is gonna be a function that inputs
5:14
points in two-dimensional space,
5:15
and watch them move to their output,
5:17
so, this is gonna be a function that also outputs
5:19
in two dimensions.
5:20
And I'm just gonna watch every single point
5:22
move over to where it's supposed to go.
5:24
These can be kind of complicated to look at,
5:27
or to think about at first,
5:28
but as you gain a little bit of thought
5:30
and exposure to them,
5:31
they're actually very nice,
5:32
and it provides a beautiful connection
5:34
with linear algebra.
5:36
A lot of you out there,
5:37
if you're studying multivariable calculus,
5:38
you either are about to study linear algebra,
5:40
or you just have, or maybe you're doing it concurrently,
5:43
but understanding functions as transformations
5:45
is gonna be a great way to connect those two.
5:47
So with that,
5:48
I'll stop jabbering through these topics really quickly
5:51
and in the next few videos
5:53
I'll actually go through them in detail
5:55
and hopefully you can get a good feel
5:57
for what multivariable functions can actually feel like.
