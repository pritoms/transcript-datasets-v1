    {"text": "Hello and welcome", "context": "to multivariable calculus.",},
    {"text": "So I think I should probably start off", "context": "by addressing the elephant in the living room here.",},
    {"text": "I am, sadly, not Sal,", "context": "but I'm still gonna teach you some math.",},
    {"text": "My name is Grant.", "context": "I'm pretty much a math enthusiast.",},
    {"text": "I enjoy making animations of things when applicable,", "context": "and boy, is that applicable",},
    {"text": "when it comes to multivariable calculus.", "context": "So, the first thing we gotta get straight",},
    {"text": "is what is this word multivariable", "context": "that separates calculus, as we know it,",},
    {"text": "from the new topic that you're about to study?", "context": "Well, I could say it's all about multivariable functions,",},
    {"text": "that doesn't really answer anything", "context": "because what's a multivariable function?",},
    {"text": "And basically, the kinds of functions", "context": "that we're used to dealing with,",},
    {"text": "in the old world, in the ordinary calculus world,", "context": "will have a single input, some kind of number",},
    {"text": "as their input,", "context": "and then the output is just a single number.",},
    {"text": "And you would call this a single variable function.", "context": "Basically because that guy there is the single variable.",},
    {"text": "So then a multivariable function", "context": "is something that handles multiple variables.",},
    {"text": "So, you know, it's common to write it as x, y,", "context": "it doesn't really matter what letters to use,",},
    {"text": "and it could be, you know, x, y, z,", "context": "x one, x two, x three, a whole bunch of things,",},
    {"text": "but just to get started,", "context": "we often think just two variables",},
    {"text": "and this will output something that depends on", "context": "both of those.",},
    {"text": "Commonly it will output just a number,", "context": "so you might imagine a number that depends on",},
    {"text": "x and y in some way, like, x squared plus y,", "context": "but it could also output a vector, right?",},
    {"text": "So you could also imagine something that's", "context": "got multivariable input, f of x, y,",},
    {"text": "and it outputs something that also has", "context": "multiple variables, like,",},
    {"text": "I mean I'm just making stuff up here,", "context": "three x and, you know, two y.",},
    {"text": "And, this isn't set in stone,", "context": "but the convention is to usually think",},
    {"text": "if there's multiple numbers that go into the output,", "context": "think of it as a vector,",},
    {"text": "if there's multiple numbers that go into the input,", "context": "just kind of write them,",},
    {"text": "write them more sideways like this,", "context": "and think of them as a point in space.",},
    {"text": "Because, I mean when you look at something like this,", "context": "and you've got an x and you've got a y,",},
    {"text": "you could think about those as two separate numbers.", "context": "You know, here's your number line",},
    {"text": "with the point x on it somewhere,", "context": "maybe that's five, maybe that's three,",},
    {"text": "it doesn't really matter.", "context": "And then you've got another number line",},
    {"text": "and it's y, and you could think of them", "context": "as separate entities.",},
    {"text": "But, it would probably be more accurate", "context": "to call it multidimensional calculus,",},
    {"text": "because, really, instead of thinking of, you know,", "context": "x and y as separate entities,",},
    {"text": "whenever you see two things like that", "context": "you're gonna be thinking about the x y plane.",},
    {"text": "And thinking about just a single point.", "context": "And you'd think of this as a function that takes a point",},
    {"text": "to a number,", "context": "or a point to a vector.",},
    {"text": "And a lot of people, when they start", "context": "teaching multivariable calculus,",},
    {"text": "they just jump into the calculus,", "context": "and there's lots of fun things,",},
    {"text": "partial derivatives, gradients,", "context": "good stuff that you'll learn.",},
    {"text": "But I think first of all,", "context": "I want to spend a couple videos",},
    {"text": "just talking about the different ways", "context": "we visualize the different types",},
    {"text": "of multivariable functions.", "context": "So, as a sneak peak,",},
    {"text": "I'm just gonna go through a couple of them", "context": "really quickly right now,",},
    {"text": "just so you kind of whet your appetite", "context": "and see what I'm getting at,",},
    {"text": "but the next few videos are going to go through them", "context": "in much, much more detail.",},
    {"text": "So, first of all,", "context": "graphs.",},
    {"text": "When you have multivariable functions,", "context": "graphs become three dimensional.",},
    {"text": "But these only really apply to functions that have", "context": "some kind of two-dimensional input,",},
    {"text": "which you might think about as living", "context": "on this x y plane,",},
    {"text": "and a single number as their output", "context": "and the height of the graph",},
    {"text": "is gonna correspond with that output.", "context": "Like I said, you'll be able to learn much more",},
    {"text": "about that in the dedicated video on it,", "context": "but these functions also can be visualized",},
    {"text": "just in two dimensions, flattening things out.", "context": "Where we visualize the entire input space",},
    {"text": "in associated color, with each point.", "context": "So this is the kind of thing where you, you know,",},
    {"text": "you have some function", "context": "that's got a two-dimensional input,",},
    {"text": "that would be f of x, y,", "context": "and what we're looking at is the x y plane,",},
    {"text": "all of the input space,", "context": "and this output's just some number,",},
    {"text": "you know, maybe it's like x squared,", "context": "this particular one is an x squared,",},
    {"text": "but, you know that,", "context": "and maybe some complicated thing,",},
    {"text": "and the color tells you roughly the size", "context": "of that output, and the lines here,",},
    {"text": "called contour lines,", "context": "tell you which inputs all share a constant output value.",},
    {"text": "And again, I'll go into much more detail there.", "context": "These are really nice, much more convenient",},
    {"text": "than three-dimensional graphs,", "context": "to just sketch out.",},
    {"text": "Moving right along,", "context": "I'm also gonna talk about surfaces",},
    {"text": "in three-dimensional space.", "context": "They look like graphs,",},
    {"text": "but they actually deal with a much different animal,", "context": "that you could think of it as mapping two dimensions,",},
    {"text": "and I like to sort of spoosh it about.", "context": "And we've got kind of a two-dimensional input,",},
    {"text": "that somehow moves into three dimensions,", "context": "and you're just looking at what the output",},
    {"text": "of that looks like,", "context": "not really caring about how it gets there.",},
    {"text": "These are called parametric surfaces.", "context": "Another fun one is a vector field,",},
    {"text": "where every input point is associated", "context": "with some kind of vector,",},
    {"text": "which is the output of the function there.", "context": "So this would be a function",},
    {"text": "with a two-dimensional input", "context": "and a two-dimensional output",},
    {"text": "'cause each of these are two-dimensional vectors.", "context": "And the fun part with these guys",},
    {"text": "is that you can just kind of,", "context": "imagine a fluid flowing,",},
    {"text": "so here's a bunch of droplets, like water,", "context": "and they kind of flow along that.",},
    {"text": "And that actually turns out to give insight", "context": "about the underlying function.",},
    {"text": "It's one of those beautiful aspects", "context": "of multivariable calc.",},
    {"text": "And we'll get lots of exposure to that.", "context": "Again, I'm just sort of zipping through",},
    {"text": "to whet your appetite.", "context": "Don't worry if this doesn't make sense immediately.",},
    {"text": "And one of my all-time favorite ways to think about", "context": "multivariable functions is to just take the input space,",},
    {"text": "in this case, this is gonna be a function that inputs", "context": "points in two-dimensional space,",},
    {"text": "and watch them move to their output,", "context": "so, this is gonna be a function that also outputs",},
    {"text": "in two dimensions.", "context": "And I'm just gonna watch every single point",},
    {"text": "move over to where it's supposed to go.", "context": "These can be kind of complicated to look at,",},
    {"text": "or to think about at first,", "context": "but as you gain a little bit of thought",},
    {"text": "and exposure to them,", "context": "they're actually very nice,",},
    {"text": "and it provides a beautiful connection", "context": "with linear algebra.",},
    {"text": "A lot of you out there,", "context": "if you're studying multivariable calculus,",},
    {"text": "you either are about to study linear algebra,", "context": "or you just have, or maybe you're doing it concurrently,",},
    {"text": "but understanding functions as transformations", "context": "is gonna be a great way to connect those two.",},
    {"text": "So with that,", "context": "I'll stop jabbering through these topics really quickly",},
    {"text": "and in the next few videos", "context": "I'll actually go through them in detail",},
    {"text": "and hopefully you can get a good feel", "context": "for what multivariable functions can actually feel like.",},
